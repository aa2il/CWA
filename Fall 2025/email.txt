Hello OMs,

Hope this finds you all well.

Its that time of year again.  The CWops CW Open is only a few weeks away.  We're putting together yet another Brass Flounders Team to enter in this year's contest.  As always, we have no delusions of winning anything - its just for the camaraderie and extra motivation to increase Butt In Chair) time.   Please let me know if you'd like to join our merry band of misfits.

Please use headphones and be prepared to send a short test message with your paddles and keyer.
